Modern descendants of this [[Proto-Dravidian language|ancient Dravidian]] word include [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] \'\'va???utina\'\' and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] \'\'va???utu???ai\'\'.\n\nThe Dravidian word was borrowed into the [[Indic languages]], giving ancient forms such as [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] \'\'v??ti???-ga???a\'\' (alongside Sanskrit \'\'v??tigama\'\') and [[Prakrit]] \'\'v??i???a???a\'\'. According to the entry \'\'brinjal\'\' in the \'\'[[Oxford English Dictionary]]\'\', the Sanskrit word \'\'v??tin-g??na\'\' denoted ???the class (that removes) the wind-disorder (windy humour)???: that is, \'\'v??tin-g??na\'\' came to be the name for egg-plants because they were thought to cure [[flatulence]]. The modern [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] words descending directly from the Sanskrit name are \'\'baingan\'\' and \'\'began\'\'.\n\nThe Indic word \'\'v??ti???-ga???a\'\' was then borrowed into [[Persian language|Persian]] as \'\'b??ding??n\'\'. Persian \'\'b??ding??n\'\' was borrowed in turn into Arabic as \'\'b?????inj??n\'\' (or, with the [[definite article]], \'\'al-b?????inj??n\'\'). From Arabic, the word was borrowed into European languages.\n\n====From Arabic into Iberia and beyond====\nIn [[al-Andalus]], the Arabic word \'\'(al-)b?????inj??n\'\' was borrowed into the [[Romance languages]] in forms beginning with \'\'b\'\'- or, with the definite article included, \'\'alb\'\'-:\n* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] \'\'bringella\'\', \'\'bringiela\'\', earlier \'\'beringela\'\'.\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \'\'berengena\'\', \'\'alberengena\'\'.\n\nThe Spanish word \'\'alberengena\'\' was then borrowed into French, giving \'\'aubergine\'\' (along with French dialectal forms like \'\'albergine\'\', \'\'albergaine\'\', \'\'albergame\'\', and \'\'beling??le\'\'). The French name was then borrowed into British English, appearing there first in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThrough the [[colonialism|colonial expansion]] of Portugal, the Portuguese form \'\'bringella\'\' was borrowed into a variety of other languages:\n* Indian English and South African English \'\'brinjal\'\', \'\'brinjaul\'\' (first attested in the seventeenth century).\n* [[Malay language|Malay]] \'\'berinjal??\'\'.\n* [[West Indian English]] \'\'brinjalle\'\' and (through [[folk-etymology]]) \'\'brown-jolly\'\'.\n\nThus although Indian English \'\'brinjal\'\' ultimately originates in languages of the Indian Subcontinent, it actually came into Indian English via Portuguese.\n\n====From Arabic into Greek and beyond====\n[[File:MS 626, folio CLXXV Wellcome L0075018.jpg|thumb|Illustrations of an eggplant from a possibly fifteenth-century French manuscript of a work by [[Matthaeus Platearius]].

The Greek loans took a variety of forms, but crucially they began with \'\'m-\'\', partly because Greek lacked the sound \'\'b-\'\' and partly through [[folk-etymology|folk-etymological]] association with the Greek word \'\'??????????\'\' (\'\'melas\'\'), \'black\'. Attested Greek forms include \'\'????????????????????\'\' (\'\'matizanion\'\', eleventh-century), \'\'????????????????????\'\' (\'\'melintzana\'\', fourteenth-century), and \'\'????????????????????????\'\' (\'\'melintzanion\'\', seventeenth-century).\n\nFrom Greek, the word was borrowed into [[Italian language|Italian]] and medieval [[Latin]], and onwards into French. Early forms include:\n* \'\'Melanz??na\'\', recorded in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] in the twelfth century.\n* \'\'Melongena\'\', recorded in Latin in the thirteenth century.\n* \'\'Melongiana\'\', recorded in [[Veronese language|Veronese]] in the fourteenth century.\n* \'\'Melanjan\'\', recorded in [[Old French]].\n\nFrom these forms came the botanical Latin \'\'melong??na\'\'. This was used by [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] as a [[genus]] name in 1700, then by [[Linnaeus]] as a [[species]] name in 1753. It remains in scientific use.\n\nThese forms also gave rise to the [[Caribbean English]] \'\'melongene\'\'.\n\nThe Italian \'\'melanzana\'\', through [[folk-etymology]], was adapted to \'\'mela insana\'\' (\'mad apple\'): already by the thirteenth century, this name had given rise to a tradition that egg-plants could cause insanity.

They are steamed, [[Stir frying|stir-fried]], or pan-fried and eaten as [[banchan]] (side dishes), such as \'\'[[namul]]\'\', \'\'[[bokkeum]]\'\', and \'\'[[Jeon (food)|jeon]]\'\'.<ref name="Maclang">{{Cite news|last=Maclang|first=Jon Khristian|title=North, South, Go Pick!

Owing to its versatile nature and wide use in both everyday and festive Indian food, it is often described as the "king of vegetables". Roasted, skinned, mashed, mixed with [[onion]]s, [[tomato]]es, and [[spice]]s, and then slow cooked gives the [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] dish \'\'[[baingan bharta]]\'\' or \'\'gojju\'\', similar to \'\'[[salat?? de vinete]]\'\' in [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]]. Another version of the dish, \'\'begun-pora\'\' (eggplant charred or burnt), is very popular in Bangladesh and the east Indian states of [[Odisha]] and [[West Bengal]] where the pulp of the vegetable is mixed with raw chopped shallot, green chilies, salt, fresh coriander, and mustard oil. Sometimes fried tomatoes and deep-fried potatoes are also added, creating a dish called \'\'begun bhorta\'\'. In a dish from Maharashtra called \'\'bharli vangi\'\', small brinjals are stuffed with ground [[coconut]], [[peanut]]s, onions, tamarind, jaggery and [[Masala (spice)|masala spices]], and then cooked in oil.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Brinjal Masala Fry.JPG|Brinjal masala fry\nFile:Brinjal&Mango Sambar.JPG|Brinjal and mango sambar\n</gallery>\n\n=== Middle East and the Mediterranean ===\nEggplant is often stewed, as in the French \'\'[[ratatouille]]\'\', or deep-fried as in the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] \'\'[[Parmigiana|parmigiana di melanzane]]\'\', the Turkish \'\'[[karn??yar??k]]\'\', or Turkish, Greek, and [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]] \'\'musakka/[[moussaka]]\'\', and [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] and South Asian dishes. Eggplants can also be battered before deep-frying and served with a sauce made of [[tahini]] and tamarind. In [[Iranian cuisine]], it is blended with whey as \'\'[[kashk e bademjan]]\'\', tomatoes as \'\'[[Mirza Ghassemi|mirza ghassemi]]\'\', or made into stew as \'\'[[Khoresh bademjan|khoresh-e-bademjan]]\'\'. It can be sliced and deep-fried, then served with plain [[yogurt]] (optionally topped with a tomato and garlic sauce), such as in the [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish dish]] \'\'patl??can k??zartmas??\'\' (meaning fried aubergines), or without yogurt, as in \'\'patl??can ??ak??uka\'\'. Perhaps the best-known Turkish eggplant dishes are \'\'[[imam bay??ld??]]\'\' (vegetarian) and \'\'[[karn??yar??k]]\'\' (with minced meat).\n\nIt may also be roasted in its skin until charred, so the pulp can be removed and blended with other ingredients, such as lemon, tahini, and garlic, as in the [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] \'\'[[baba ghanoush]]\'\' and the similar [[Greek cuisine|Greek]] \'\'[[melitzanosalata]]\'\'. A mix of roasted eggplant, roasted red peppers, chopped onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and spices is called \'\'[[zacusc??]]\'\' in [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]], and \'\'[[ajvar]]\'\' or \'\'[[pinjur]]\'\' in the [[Balkan cuisine|Balkans]].\n\nA Spanish dish called \'\'[[escalivada]]\'\' in [[Catalonia]] calls for strips of roasted aubergine, sweet pepper, onion, and tomato. In [[Andalusia]], eggplant is mostly cooked thinly sliced, deep-fried in olive oil and served hot with honey (\'\'berenjenas a la Cordobesa\'\'). In the [[La Mancha]] region of central Spain, a small eggplant is pickled in vinegar, paprika, olive oil, and red peppers. The result is berenjena of [[Almagro, Ciudad Real]].\n\nA Levantine specialty is \'\'[[makdous]]\'\', another pickling of eggplants, stuffed with red peppers and walnuts in olive oil.\n\nEggplant can be hollowed out and stuffed with meat, rice, or other fillings, and then baked. In the [[Caucasus]], for example, it is fried and stuffed with [[walnut paste]] to make \'\'[[nigvziani badrijani]]\'\'.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Melanzane alla Parmigiana.jpg|\'\'[[Parmigiana|Parmigiana di melanzane]], "[[eggplant parmesan]]"\nFile:Penne with eggplant and basil in yogurt-tomato sauce.jpg|[[Penne]] with eggplant and [[basil]] in yogurt-tomato sauce.

Eggplant grown in [[temperate]] climates fares better when transplanted into the garden after all danger of frost has passed. Eggplant prefers hot weather, and when grown in cold climates or in areas with low humidity, the plants languish or fail to set and produce mature fruit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.growveg.com/guides/how-to-grow-eggplant-in-cooler-climates/|title=How to Grow Eggplant in Cooler Climates|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gardenmentors.com/garden-help/grow-your-own-food/growing-eggplant-successfully-in-cooler-climates/|title=Growing Eggplant Successfully in Cooler Climates ???

[[Mulch]]ing helps conserve moisture and prevent weeds and fungal diseases and the plants benefit from some shade during the hottest part of the day. [[Hand pollination]] by shaking the flowers improves the set of the first blossoms. Growers typically cut fruits from the vine just above the calyx owing to the somewhat woody stems. Flowers are [[Plant sexuality#Basic flower morphology|complete]], containing both female and male structures, and may be [[Self-pollination|self-]] or [[Cross pollination#Mechanics|cross-pollinated]].<ref name="Polination of Vegetable Crops">{{cite web| last=Westerfield| first=Robert| url=http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubs/PDF/C934.pdf| title=Pollination of Vegetable Crops| accessdate=2009-07-01| date=2008-11-14| format=PDF| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613160517/http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubs/PDF/C934.pdf| archivedate=2010-06-13| df=}}</ref>\n\nMany of the pests and diseases that afflict other [[Solanaceae|solanaceous]] plants, such as tomato, capsicum, and potato, are also troublesome to eggplants. For this reason, it should generally not be planted in areas previously occupied by its close relatives. However, since eggplants can be particularly susceptible to pests such as [[Whitefly|whiteflies]], they are sometimes grown with slightly less susceptible plants, such as [[Chili pepper|chili pepper]], as a sacrificial [[trap crop]]. Four years should separate successive crops of eggplants to reduce pest pressure.\n\nCommon North American pests include the [[Colorado potato beetle|potato beetles]], [[flea beetle]]s, [[aphid]]s, whiteflies, and [[Tetranychus urticae|spider mites]]. Good sanitation and [[crop rotation]] practices are extremely important for controlling fungal disease, the most serious of which is \'\'[[Verticillium]]\'\'.\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Eggplant production map FAOSTAT 2014.png|thumb|452x452px|Production of eggplant in 2013 by country<ref name="FAOSTAT">{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC/visualize|title=FAOSTAT |accessdate=2018-01-26 |work=FAO }}</ref>]]\n\nIn 2016, global production of eggplants was 51.3 million [[tonnes]].<ref name="FAOSTAT" /> That year, almost 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) were devoted to the cultivation of eggplants in the world.

However, \'\'[[Solanum incanum]]\'\' and [[cockroach berry]] (\'\'S. capsicoides\'\'), other eggplant-like nightshades described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and [[Carlo Allioni|Allioni]], respectively, were occasionally considered eggplant varieties, but this is not correct.<ref name = ss2008 />\n\nThe eggplant has a long history of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] confusion with the [[scarlet eggplant|scarlet]] and [[Ethiopian eggplant|Ethiopian]] eggplants (\'\'[[Solanum aethiopicum]])\'\', known as \'\'gilo\'\' and \'\'nakati\'\', respectively, and described by Linnaeus as \'\'S. aethiopicum\'\'.
